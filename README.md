## Description
The WordFrequenciesTwo program reads a line of text from user input and calculates the frequency of each word in the input. It then prints each word along with its frequency. The program uses basic string manipulation and iteration to accomplish this task.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/WordFrequenciesTwo.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd WordFrequenciesTwo 
```
- Compile the WordFrequenciesTwo.java file: 
```Java
- javac WordFrequenciesTwo.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java WordFrequenciesTwo
```

## Application Usage
The program expects a single line of text input from the user. It splits the input into words, counts the occurrences of each word, and then prints each word followed by its frequency.  Example:  

- The input begins with an integer indicating the number of words that follow.

Input:
```Java
6 apple banana apple orange banana apple 
```
Output:
```Java
apple - 3 
banana - 2 
orange - 1
```
